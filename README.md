## FET Notes

1.  Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) are controlled by current. 
1.  Field-Effect Transistors (FETs) are controlled by voltage. 

### On

When FETs are turned on, current can flow **both ways** 
between the source and drain. 
Thus, they can be used with alternating current (AC). 

### Off

When FETs are turned off, FETs act as diodes. 
This "body diode" is a natural result of how they are constructed.
Sometimes the body diode is indicated on the FET symbol. 

TODO: drawings

To cut off voltage completely, 
use two FETs with their body diodes pointing in opposite directions.

### Modes

FETs can be made in two modes, 
enhancement mode and
depletion mode. 
Enhancement mode is the most common. 

| Enhancement Mode | Depletion Mode |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Normally off          | Normally On |
| Gate turns on         | Get turns off |

### P/N Uses

The terms "sufficiently negative" and "sufficiently positive" 
are compared to the drain/source voltage. 

| | P-channel | | N-channel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | TODO: PICTURE | | TODO: PICTURE |
| 0 | "On" = the gain is "sufficiently negative" | 1 | "On" = gain is "sufficiently positive" | 
| 1 | "Off" = negative voltage removed | 0 | "Off" = positive voltage removed |
| | TODO: PICTURE | | TODO: PICTURE |
| 1 | "On" = negative voltage removed | 0 | "Off" = positive voltage removed |
| 0 | "Off" = the gain is "sufficiently negative" | 1 | "On" = gain is "sufficiently positive" |
